"Nyuki" translates to "bee" in Swahili, but is also the word used 
to refer to aerial drones. While working on a collaboration between 
[DataKind](https://www.datakind.org/) and [WeRobotics](https://werobotics.org/)
using drone imagery for flood damage assessment, we found it 
really hard to do simple manipulations to large geotiff image and vector
files. Something as simple as resizing an image took 15-20 lines 
complicated code. Hence we designed Nyuki to help turn these cumbersome 
tasks into one-line commands. We started with a few common 
operations but hope to expand. Contributions are always welcome. Also please
give us a star if you like our tool.

üßê About 
--------

Nyuki is a command line tool that simplifies common and easy image
processing tasks. The tools implemented so far include:

-  Reprojecting geotiff and vector files
-  Resampling geotiff files to higher or lower resolution
-  Compressing geotiff files to save space
