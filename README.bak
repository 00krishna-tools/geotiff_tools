<p align="justified"> "Nyuki" translates to "bee" in Swahili, but is also the word used 
                   to refer to aerial drones. While working on a collaboration between 
                   <a href="https://www.datakind.org/">DataKind</a> and 
                   <a href="https://werobotics.org/">WeRobotics</a>
                   using drone imagery for flood damage assessment, we found it 
                   really hard to do simple manipulations to large geotiff image and vector
                   files. Something as simple as resizing an image took 15-20 lines 
                   complicated code. Hence we designed Nyuki to help turn these cumbersome 
                   tasks into one-line commands. We started with a few common 
                   operations but hope to expand. Contributions are always welcome. Also please
                   give us a star if you like our tool.

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Nyuki is a command line tool that simplifies common and easy image processing tasks. The tools implemented so far include:

* Reprojecting geotiff and vector files
* Resampling geotiff files to higher or lower resolution
* Compressing geotiff files to save space

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
